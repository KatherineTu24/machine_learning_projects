### Introduction - Wine Quality Project
In winequality.zip, you will find three files — winequality.names, winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv. ‘‘winequality.names’’ contains a description of the dataset and the remaining files contain data. These files contain data from a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars [Cortez et al., 2009]. Read the description file carefully. The data consists of 11 features containing various sensory and physicochemical properties of wine and a single target variable "Quality" (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts).

### Introduction - Online News Popularity Project
The popularity of online news can depend on multiple factors like the Website where it was published, the content, etc. Websites often track viewing statistics for individual articles to better understand the type of content their users are looking for. In this project, you are provided with information for 39,797 online news articles [Fernandes et al., 2015]. For each article, you are provided with statistics on the word, topic, and sentiment level.
