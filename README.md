#### This repository is to showcase my hands-on technical skills of applying Machine Learning theories in real-world datasets
### Introduction
In winequality.zip, you will find three files — winequality.names, winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv. ‘‘winequality.names’’ contains a description of the dataset and the remaining files contain data. These files contain data from a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars [Cortez et al., 2009]. Read the description file carefully. The data consists of 11 features containing various sensory and physicochemical properties of wine and a single target variable "Quality" (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts).
